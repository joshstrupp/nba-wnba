# The NBA versus the WNBA – Superstar Similarities, Stylistic Disparities, and the Impact on the Wage Gap
This is the data behind a three-part essay that uses statistics and proprietary data to explore how the NBA and WNBA's biggest stars align, why (despite their similarities) they're paid differently, and why their differences in style and strategy is something to celebrate. The author is me, [Josh Strupp](http://joshstrupp.com) - product designer at [Taoti Creative](http://taoti.com) by day, data hobbyist the rest of the time.

Part I:
* Outlier Status: A glance at superstardom.
* Superstar Similarities: Which NBA and WNBA players are (nearly) statistically identical?

Part II:
* Systemic Biases: Economies of scale, participation gaps, and more red flags as seen through chess, the MLS, and eSports.

Part III:
* Stylistic Disparities: how the WNBA's strategy is better for fans and a data-driven look at "hero ball."
* In Conclusion: Thoughts on the latest WNBA collective bargaining agreement, a plea to engage with the sport, and a Kobe quote.
